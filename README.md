# continuous_piecewise_polyfit

a continuous piecewise polynomial fitting algorithm of any order with harmonics

if any problem, please contact mingyuxiao@whu.edu.cn

main.m is the main file

*.p files are functions called by main.m, where continuous_piecewise_polyfit.p implements the continuous piecewise polynomial fitting algorithm

global_basin_timeseries.xlsx contains the data of ocean mass change contributed by glacier mass loss

the folder figure contains the figures generated by main.m
